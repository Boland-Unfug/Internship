Ok for data processing all I really need is in the pool section, there is a daily count and a member count several rows below that
#TODO make first repo - DONE
#TODO make program to grab data and condense to one file
- Extraction process made, need to clarify what admissions/covers is
- Need to convert dates to something better
- need to standardize numbers to integers (all are positive non decimals)

Updated plan:
#TODO create mass Extraction
- get file names
- extract each file
#TODO clean data
- create complete data cleaning function
- create a properly dated dataset - DONE
- fill in properly dated dataset
#TODO add command line features
